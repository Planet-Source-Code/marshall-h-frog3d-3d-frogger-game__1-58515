1.1 Introduction

Hello,
My name is Marshall H. I spent about 4 months
making Frog3D, and I hope that you can enjoy and
learn from its source code.

Because of the work that I have put into this game,
I would ask that you not copy any part of it in
any way, take any part of it as your own, or take
credit for the hard work I've spent on it.

1.2 Disclaimer

I (Marshall H.) do not take any responsibility for
any adverse effects this software or code may have
on your computer. If you encounter problems while
running this program, please do not mail me about
it is a piece of junk, instead chill out and keep 
it to yourself.

2.1 Source Code Notes

The source code for Frog3D is somewhat commented,
hopefully enough to help you see what is going on
in the code. I believe the best way to learn to
program is to look at others' examples and to see
how they achieve their goals.
Also, please don't use this as an example for 
starting out with 3D graphics in Visual Basic.
Instead, you should learn DirectX 8.0 or 9 in
Intermediate Mode (IM). Although IM is a bit
harder, it's what the pros use and it is better
in the long run. I say this now because if I
would have started out with that, I would be
in a lot better shape now.

2.2 Config App Notes

To change the configuration for Frog3D, you must
compile the Config app in \Config.vbp. Put the 
EXE file in the main game folder, and then run it.
You can't run the Config app from the IDE, you
*MUST* compile it and move the EXE to the main 
folder.

2.3 Music Notes

For this distribution to fit in Planet Source
Code's file size constraints, I've zeroed out
the background music file (menuhigh.wav).
If you want to hear the music, you can download
it from
http://gamesoft.dyndns.org/frog3d/menuhigh.zip


Enjoy!
