### Description

Frog3D is a 3D frogger game, with DirectX graphics and sound. The goal of the game is to get the frog across the road without becoming road pizza, and get him across the pirahna-infested river.

I spent more than 4 months on this game that I made about a year ago, and hopefully you will be able to learn something from it.

If you have any problems downloading this, you can get it also at

I'm hoping to get Code of the Month with this game, so please vote for this game!
